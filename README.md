# Weightlifting-Logger
Python script that connects with CSV to log and calculate stats for weight lifting

This script features an interative prompt system allowing the user to navigate a series of questions to provide user input to the script. The input is then taken in the form of data to be written to a CSV file. 
Upon writting the data the script also performs a calculation and autofills that information into the CSV which can be recalled later by the user. 
The purpose of this project was to have an all in one location for weightlifters to be able to track their lifts and their total volume output for the week and have it autocalcualted without doing the calculation themselves. It also allows for an easy to use prompts to fill in their information and create exercises.
This would be simialr to logic in mainstream applications you would find for your mobile device.
